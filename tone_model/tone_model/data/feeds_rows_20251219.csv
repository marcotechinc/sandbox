So we built Zenflow, a free desktop tool to orchestrate AI coding workflows.It handles the things we were missing in standard chat interfaces:Cross-Model Verification: You can have Codex review Claudeâ€™s code, or run them in parallel to see which model handles the specific context better.Parallel Execution: Run five different approaches on a backlog item simultaneouslyâ€”mix Human-in-the-Loop for hard problems with YOLO runs for simple tasks.Dynamic Workflows: Configured via simple .md files. Agents can actually rewire the next steps of the workflow dynamically based on the problem at hand.Project listkanban views across all workloadWhat we learned building thisTo tune Zenflow, we ran 100+ experiments across public benchmarks (SWE-Bench-*, T-Bench) and private datasets. Two major takeaways that might interest this community:Benchmark Saturation: Models are becoming progressively overtrained on all versions of SWE-Bench (even Pro). We found public results are diverging significantly from performance on private datasets. If you are building workflows, you cant rely on public benches.The Goldilocks Workflow: In autonomous mode, heavy multi-step processes often multiply errors rather than fix them. Massive, complex prompt templates look good on paper but fail in practice. The most reliable setups landed in a narrow â€œGoldilocksâ€ zone of just enough structure without over-orchestration.The app is free to use and supports Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and Zencoder.Weâ€™ve been dogfooding this heavily, but Id love to hear your thoughts on the default workflows and if they fit your mental model for agentic coding.Download: https:zencoder.aizenflow (https:zencoder.aizenflow)

Iâ€™m a researcher working on Bitcoin smart contracts, and today Iâ€™m releasing Bithovenâ€”a high-level imperative language that compiles to native Bitcoin Script (Legacy, SegWit, and Taproot).The Goal:Raw Bitcoin Script is notoriously difficult to reason about. Writing raw Bitcoin Script today feels like writing Assembly in the 1970s. You have to mentally juggle the stack (`OP_SWAP`, `OP_ROT`), manually manage distinct execution branches, and pray you didnt leave a stack item unconsumed (which crashes the script). My goal was to bridge the gap between complex contract logic and raw opcodes, allowing developers to write readable, compile-time-safe code.Key Features:- Imperative Syntax: Write logic using familiar ifelse and return statements instead of mental stack juggling.- Type Safety: First-class support for bool, signature, string, and number types to prevent runtime errors.- Targeted Compilation: Support for Legacy, SegWit, and Taproot compilation targets.- Native Primitives: Built-in keywords for timelocks (older, after) and cryptography (sha256, checksig).You can try it in the browser here (runs via WASM): https:bithoven-lang.github.iobithovenide (https:bithoven-lang.github.iobithovenide)Here is an example of a Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC):  (condition: bool, sig_alice: signature)  (condition: bool, preimage: string, sig_bob: signature)  {      if condition {           Relative locktime (Sequence)          older 1000;          return checksig (sig_alice, alice_pk);      } else {           Hashlock verification          verify sha256 sha256 preimage == hash;          return checksig (sig_bob, bob_pk);      }  } The project is free open source and the academic paper is currently under review. Iâ€™d love to hear any feedback. Thanks for checking it out!",2025-12-20 00:54:17.04327+00,Blockchain,positive,Product Launch

Paul Grahamâ€™s idea that essays are a way to learn really resonates with me. But I rarely publish anything beyond occasional LinkedIn posts.My blockers:â€¢â€œNobody needs thisâ€  â€œItâ€™s not originalâ€â€¢â€œAI can explain most topics better than I canâ€â€¢A bit of fear: shipping something that feels naive or low-signalAt the same time, I read a lot of personal blogs + LinkedIn and I do get real value from them â€” mostly from perspective, lived experience, and clear thinking, not novelty.For those of you who blog (or used to):â€¢What made it worth it for you?â€¢What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)?â€¢Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)?â€¢If you were starting today, what would you do differently?Iâ€™m not trying to build a media business â€” more like building a â€œpublic notebookâ€ that compounds over years.",2025-12-16 02:46:49.768566+00,AI,neutral,Opinion

Email is too slow. But sometimes you do need a note in your face.I found myself missing 1990s pagers. I wanted a digital equivalent - something that does one thing: beep until I ack it.So I built UDP-7777.Concept:- 0% Cloud: It listens on UDP Port 7777. No accounts, no central servers. You dont need TailscaleZeroTierWGetc, its just easy for device sets.- CAPCODES: It maps your IP address (LAN or Tailscale) to a retro 10-digit CAPCODE that looks like a phone number (e.g., (213) 070-6433 for loopback).- Minimalism: Bare-bones interface. Just a box, a few buttons, and a big red blinker.The Tech:Its a single binary written in Go (using Fyne). It implements burst fire UDP (sending packets 3x) to ensure delivery without the handshake overhead of TCP.New in v2.2.7:- Frequency Tuning: Bind specifically to your TailscaleZeroTier interface.- Squelch: Optional shared-secret keys to ignore unauthorized packets.- Heartbeat: VisualAudio alerts that persist until you physically click ACK.I built this for anyone looking to cut through the noiseâ€”DevOps teams handing off the on-call IP, or deep-work focus where you only want interruptions from a
high-trust circle.Id love to hear your thoughts on the IP-to-Phone-Number mapping logic (its purely visual, but Im really into it).Site  Binaries (Signed for MacWin): https:udp7777.com (https:udp7777.com)",2025-12-16 02:46:00.312527+00,Other,positive,Product Launch

1da42f3e-3341-4fc9-ab2e-e09b68efaf4d,Show HN: TheAuditor v2.0 â€“ A â€œFlight Computerâ€ for AI Coding Agents,2025-12-16T13:50:15.000Z,Hacker News,"Iâ€™m a former Systems Architect (CiscoVMware) turned builder in Thailand. TheAuditor v2.0 is a complete architectural rewrite (800+ commits) of the prototype I posted three months ago.The A-ha moment for me didnt come from a success; it came from a massive failure. I was trying to use AI to refactor a complex schema change (a foundation change from Products to ProductsVariants), and due to the scope of it, it failed spectacularly. I realized two things:* Context Collapse: The AI couldnt keep enough files in its context window to understand the full scope of the refactor, so it started hallucinating, fixing superficial issues. If I kept pressing it, it would literally panic and make up problems so it could fix them, which only resulted in the situation going into a death spiral. Thatâ€™s the villain origin story of this tool. :D
* Stale Knowledge: It kept trying to implement Node 16 patterns in a Node 22 project, or defaulting to obsolete libraries (like glob v7 instead of v11) because its training data was stale.I realized that AI agents are phenomenal at outputting working code, but they have zero understanding of it. They optimize for making it run at any costâ€”often by introducing security holes or technical debt just to bypass an error. This is a funny paradox because when corneredforced to use cutting-edge versions, syntax, and best practices, it has zero issue executing or coding it. However, itâ€™s so hilariously unaware of its surroundings that it will do anything else unless explicitly babysat.I built v2 to be the Sanity Check that solves a lot of these issues, and it aims to continue solving more of the same and similar issues I face. Instead of letting the AI guess, TheAuditor indexes the entire codebase into a local SQLite Graph Database. This gives the AI a queryable map of reality, allowing it to verify dependencies and imports without needing to load all files into context.AB Demo: https:www.youtube.comwatch?v=512uqMaZlTg (https:www.youtube.comwatch?v=512uqMaZlTg)
As seen in the demo video, instead of trying to read 10+ full files andor grepping to make up for the hallucinations, it can now run aud explain and get 500 lines of deterministic facts only information. It gets just what it needs to see versus reading 10+ files, trying to keep them in context, finding what it was looking for, and trying to remember why it was looking to begin with.I also learned that regexstringheuristics dont scale at all and are painfully slow (hours vs minutes). I tried the regex-based rulesparsers approach, but they kept failing silently on complex files and suffered constant limitations (the worst offender was having to read all files per set of rules). I scrapped that approach and built a Triple-Entry Fidelity system. 
Now, the tool acts like a ledger: the parser emits a manifest, the DB emits a receipt. If they dont match, the system crashes intentionally.Itâ€™s no longer just a scanner; itâ€™s a guardrail. In my daily workflow, I dont let the AI write a line of code until the AI (my choice just happens to be CCCodex) has run a pre-investigation for whatever problem statement Im facing at the moment. This ensures its anchored in facts and not inference assumptions or, worse, hallucinations.With that said, my tool isnt perfect. To support it all, I had to build a pseudo-compiler for PythonJSTS, and that means preparing extractors for every framework, every syntaxâ€”everything, really. Sometimes I dont get it right, and sometimes I just wont have had enough time to build it out to support everything.So, my recommendation is to integrate the tool WITH your AI agent of choice rather than seeing it as a tool for you, the human. I like to use the tool as a confirm or deny, where the AI runs the tool, verifies in source code, and presents a pre-implementation audit. Based on that audit, I will create an aud planning.Some of the major milestones in v2.0* Hybrid Taint: I extended the Oracle Labs IFDS research to track data flow across microservice boundaries (e.g., React fetch â†’ Express middleware â†’ Controller).* Triple-Entry Fidelity: This works across every layer (Indexer - Extractor - Parser - Storage). Every step has fidelity checks working in unison. If there is silent data loss anywhere in the pipeline, the tool crashes intentionally.* Graph DB: Moved from file-based parsing to a SQLite Graph Database to handle complex relationships that regex missed.* Scope: Added support for Rust, Go, Bash, AWS CDK, and Terraform (v1 was PythonJS only).* Agent Capabilities: Added Planning and Refactor engines, allowing AI agents to not just scan code but safely plan and execute architectural changes",2025-12-20 00:56:49.305252+00,AI,positive,Product Launch

I needed to generate data for a dashboard where Timesheets must happen after Project Start Date, and I wanted to define these rules via natural language.How it works:
LLM Layer: Uses GroqLlama-3.3 to parse a story into a JSON schema constraint config.Simulation Layer: Uses Vectorized NumPy (no loops) to generate data. It builds a DAG of tables to ensure parent rows exist before child rows (referential integrity).Performance: Generates ~250k rowssec on my M1 Air.Itâ€™s early alpha. The Graph Reverse Engineering (describe a chart - get data) is experimental but working for simple curves.pip install misataIâ€™d love feedback on the simulator.py architectureâ€”Iâ€™m currently keeping data in-memory (Pandas) which hits a ceiling at ~10M rows.

Were building Sim (https:sim.ai (https:sim.ai)), an open-source visual editor to build agentic workflows. Repo here: https:github.comsimstudioaisim (https:github.comsimstudioaisim). Docs here: https:docs.sim.ai (https:docs.sim.ai).You can run Sim locally using Docker, with no execution limits or other restrictions.We started building Sim almost a year ago after repeatedly troubleshooting why our agents failed in production. Code-first frameworks felt hard to debug because of implicit control flow, and workflow platforms added more overhead than they removed. We wanted granular control and easy observability without piecing everything together ourselves.We launched Sim [1][2] as a drag-and-drop canvas around 6 months ago. Since then, weve added:- 138 blocks: Slack, GitHub, Linear, Notion, Supabase, SSH, TTS, SFTP, MongoDB, S3, Pinecone, ...- Tool calling with granular control: forced, auto- Agent memory: conversation memory with sliding window support (by last n messages or tokens)- Trace spans: detailed logging and observability for nested workflows and tool calling- Native RAG: upload documents, we chunk, embed with pgvector, and expose vector search to agents- Workflow deployment versioning with rollbacks- MCP support, Human-in-the-loop block- Copilot to build workflows using natural language (just shipped a new version that also acts as a superagent and can call into any of your connected services directly, not just build workflows)Under the hood, the workflow is a DAG with concurrent execution by default. Nodes run as soon as their dependencies (upstream blocks) are satisfied. Loops (for, forEach, while, do-while) and parallel fan-outjoin are also first-class primitives.Agent blocks are pass-through to the provider. You pick your model (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, vLLM), and and we pass through prompts, tools, and response format directly to the provider API. We normalize response shapes for block interoperability, but were not adding layers that obscure whats happening.Were currently working on our own MCP server and the ability to deploy workflows as MCP servers. Would love to hear your thoughts and where we should take it next :)[1] https:news.ycombinator.comitem?id=43823096 (https:news.ycombinator.comitem?id=43823096)[2] https:news.ycombinator.comitem?id=44052766 (https:news.ycombinator.comitem?id=44052766)",2025-12-16 02:49:11.291863+00,AI,positive,Product Launch

A few hours later and this was vibe coded.To use it you can use the mouse to rotate the fractal the the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. to map from 4d to 3d, one of the dims is mapped to an adjustable slider. the there is also a clipping plane slider to help visualize the internal structures of the fractal.I have mixed feelings about vibe coding. It was amazing to go from an idea to live implementation within a few hours, but in my coding projects, Ive always appreciated the journey and the learning, not just the final product. Vibe coding kind of skips to the end which is exciting and efficient, but just not as fulfilling as struggling through a project step-by-step.",2025-12-16 02:50:21.282579+00,AI,neutral,Product Launch

And not just a little (RIP to your server bill).There isnt much you can do about it without cloudflare. These companies ignore robots.txt, and youre competing with teams with more resources than you. Its you vs the MJs of programming, youre not going to win.But there is a solution. Now Im not going to say its a great solution...but a solution is a solution. If your website contains content that will trigger their scrapers safeguards, it will get dropped from their data pipelines.So heres what fuzzycanary does: it injects hundreds of invisible links to porn websites in your HTML. The links are hidden from users but present in the DOM so that scrapers can ingest them and say nope we wont scrape there again in the future.The problem with that approach is that it will absolutely nuke your websites SEO. So fuzzycanary also checks user agents and wont show the links to legitimate search engines, so Google and Bing wont see them.One caveat: if youre using a static site generator it will bake the links into your HTML for everyone, including googlebot. Does anyone have a work-around for this that doesnt involve using a proxy?Please try it out!

I rewrote the core in Rust to make it the fastest open-source single-threaded image diff. On 4K images (5600Ã—3200): ~327ms vs odiffs ~1215ms. Binaries are ~3x smaller too (~700KB vs ~2MB).
The core insight: make the cold pass smarter to make the hot pass do less work. Instead of simple pixel equality, the cold pass scans dynamic-sized blocks and marks problematic ones - blocks that might contain differences. The hot pass then only runs YIQ perceptual diff and antialiasing check on those problematic blocks, skipping everything else entirely. PNG IO uses spng (C library) via Rust bindings. SIMD throughout - NEON on ARM, SSE4.1 on x86. Drop-in replacement for odiff with the same API.",2025-12-20 00:56:15.89986+00,Other,positive,Product Launch

Email is too slow. But sometimes you do need a note in your face.I found myself missing 1990s pagers. I wanted a digital equivalent - something that does one thing: beep until I ack it.So I built UDP-7777.Concept:- 0% Cloud: It listens on UDP Port 7777. No accounts, no central servers. You dont need TailscaleZeroTierWgetc, its just easy for device sets.- CAPCODES: It maps your IP address (LAN or Tailscale) to a retro 10-digit CAPCODE that looks like a phone number (e.g., (213) 070-6433 for loopback).- Minimalism: Bare-bones interface. Just a box, a few buttons, and a big red blinker.The Tech:Its a single binary written in Go (using Fyne). It implements burst fire UDP (sending packets 3x) to ensure delivery without the handshake overhead of TCP.New in v2.2.7:- Frequency Tuning: Bind specifically to your TailscaleZeroTier interface.- Squelch: Optional shared-secret keys to ignore unauthorized packets.- Heartbeat: VisualAudio alerts that persist until you physically click ACK.I built this for anyone looking to cut through the noiseâ€”DevOps teams handing off the on-call IP, or deep-work focus where you only want interruptions from a
high-trust circle.Id love to hear your thoughts on the IP-to-Phone-Number mapping logic (its purely visual, but Im really into it).Site  Binaries (Signed for MacWin): https:udp7777.com (https:udp7777.com)",2025-12-20 00:55:59.444044+00,Other,positive,Product Launch

4d194048-ae05-48a6-9c7a-59268e7b9141,"Show HN: I open-sourced my Go and Next B2B SaaS Starter (deploy anywhere, MIT)",2025-12-19T11:34:11.000Z,Hacker News,"Hi HN, Im Mohammed, a technical founder who loves shipping and giving back to the community. Im open-sourcing the full-stack engine that powers my B2B product, apflow.co.What it is: A production B2B starter with a Go backend and Next.js frontend. Both are fully Dockerized with separate containers. No Vercel. No Supabase. Deploy the whole thing on a $6 VPS, or split frontend and backend across different providers. You own the infrastructure.The problem I was solving:Every SaaS starter I evaluated had the same issue: they locked me into someone elses platform. Vercel for hosting. PlanetScale for the database. Serverless functions billing per invocation. Fine for prototypes, but costs become unpredictable at scale and migrating away is painful.I wanted something I could deploy on any Linux box with docker-compose up. Something where I could host the frontend on Cloudflare Pages and the backend on a Hetzner VPS if I wanted. No vendor-specific APIs buried in my code.Why Go for the backend:Go gives me exactly what I need for a SaaS backend:Tiny footprint. The backend idles at ~50MB RAM. On a cheap VPS, that headroom lets me run more services without upgrading.
Concurrency without complexity. Billing webhooks, file uploads, and AI calls run concurrently without callback hell.
Compile-time type safety. Using SQLC, my SQL compiles to type-safe Go. If the query is wrong, it fails at build time, not in production.
Predictable performance. No garbage collection pauses that surprise you under load.
The architecture (Modular Monolith):I didnt want microservices complexity for a small team, but I needed clean separation. I built a Modular Monolith: features like Auth, Billing, and AI are isolated Go modules with explicit interfaces, but they deploy as a single binary.This structure also made AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude Code) dramatically more effective. Because every module has strict boundaries, the AI knows exactly where new code belongs and doesnt break other modules.Full-stack, not just backend:Backend: Go 1.25 + Gin + SQLC (type-safe SQL, no ORM) + PostgreSQL with pgvector
Frontend: Next.js 16 + React 19 + Tailwind + shadcnui
Communication: The frontend consumes a clean REST API. You can swap Next.js for any framework that speaks HTTP.
Infrastructure: Separate Dockerfiles for frontend and backend. Deploy together or apart.
Whats pre-built:The boring infrastructure is solved so you can focus on your actual product:Auth + RBAC: Stytch B2B integration with Organizations, Teams, and Roles. Multi-tenant data isolation enforced at the query level.
Billing: Polar.sh as Merchant of Record. Handles subscriptions, invoices, and global taxVAT. No Stripe webhook edge cases.
AI Pipeline: OpenAI RAG using pgvector. The retrieval service enforces strict context boundaries to minimize hallucinations.
OCR: Mistral integration for document extraction.
File Storage: Cloudflare R2 integration.
Each feature is a separate module. Dont need OCR? Remove it. Want Stripe instead of Polar? The billing interface is abstracted.Real-world proof:This isnt a template I made for GitHub stars. Its the exact code running apflow.co in production. When I added document OCR, I built it as a new module without touching Auth or Billing. The architecture held.How to try it:Clone the repo, read setup.md to check the prerequisite, run .setup.sh, and you have a working B2B environment locally in minutes.Feedback I want:Id appreciate feedback from Go developers on the module boundaries and cross-module interfaces. Also curious if anyone has suggestions for the Docker setup in production deployments.GitHub: https:github.commoasqproduction-saas-starter (https:github.commoasqproduction-saas-starter)Live: https:apflow.co (https:apflow.co)",2025-12-20 00:52:27.452301+00,Other,positive,Product Launch

6d059da2-5212-4c6d-9352-e1399c64ddee,Launch HN: Pulse (YC S24) â€“ Production-grade unstructured document extraction,2025-12-18T15:35:52.000Z,Hacker News,"Hi HN, weâ€™re Sid and Ritvik, co-founders of Pulse (https:www.runpulse.com (https:www.runpulse.com)). Pulse is a document extraction system to create LLM-ready text using hybrid VLM + OCR models.Hereâ€™s a demo video: https:video.runpulse.comvideopulse-platform-walkthrough-... (https:video.runpulse.comvideopulse-platform-walkthrough-69f9).Later in this post, youâ€™ll find links to before-and-after examples on particularly tricky cases. Check those out to see what Pulse can really do!
Modern vision language models are great at producing plausible text, but that makes them risky for OCR and data ingestion. Plausibility isnâ€™t good enough when you need accuracy.When we started working on document extraction, we assumed the same thing many teams do: foundation models are improving quickly, multi-modal systems appear to read documents well, whatâ€™s not to like? And indeed, for small or clean inputs, those assumptions mostly give good results.
However, limitations show up once you begin processing real documents in volume. Long PDFs, dense tables, mixed layouts, low-fidelity scans, and financial or operational data expose errors that are subtle, hard to detect, and expensive to correct. Outputs look reasonable even though they contain small but important mistakes, especially in tables and numeric fields.Running into those challenges got us working. We ran controlled evaluations on complex documents, fine tuned vision models, and built labeled datasets where ground truth actually matters. There have been many nights where our team stayed up hand-annotating pages, drawing bounding boxes around tables, labeling charts point by point, or debating whether a number was unreadable or simply poorly scanned. That process shaped our intuition far more than benchmarks.One thing became clear quickly. The core challenge is not extraction itself, but confidence. Vision language models embed document images into high-dimensional representations optimized for semantic understanding, not precise transcription. That process is inherently lossy. When uncertainty appears, models tend to resolve it using learned priors instead of surfacing ambiguity. This behavior can be helpful in consumer settings. In production pipelines, it creates verification problems that do not scale well.
Pulse grew out of our trying to address this gap through system design rather than prompting alone.Instead of treating document understanding as a single generative step, our system separates layout analysis from language modeling. Documents are normalized into structured representations that preserve hierarchy and tables before schema mapping occurs. Extraction is constrained by schemas defined ahead of time, and extracted values are tied back to source locations so uncertainty can be inspected rather than guessed away. In practice, this results in a hybrid approach that combines traditional computer vision techniques, layout models, and vision language models, because no single approach handles these cases reliably on its own.We are intentionally sharing a few documents that reflect the types of inputs that motivated this work. These are representative of cases where we saw generic OCR or VLM-based pipelines struggle.Here is a financial 10K:

However, our goal is not to eliminate errors entirely, but to make them visible, auditable, and easier to reason about.Pulse is available via usage-based access to the API and platform You can sign up to try it at https:platform.runpulse.comlogin (https:platform.runpulse.comlogin). API docs are at https:docs.runpulse.comintroduction (https:docs.runpulse.comintroduction).Weâ€™d love to hear how others here evaluate correctness for document extraction, which failure modes you have seen in practice, and what signals you rely on to decide whether an output can be trusted.We will be around to answer questions and are happy to run additional documents if people want to share examples. Put links in the comments and weâ€™ll plug them in and get back to you.Looking forward to your comments!",2025-12-20 00:52:27.452301+00,AI,positive,Product Launch

We are the OpenDCAI group from Peking University. We built Paper2Any, an open-source tool designed to automate the Paper to Slides workflow based on our DataFlow-Agent framework.
The Problem: Writing papers is hard, but creating professional architecture diagrams and slides (PPTs) is often more tedious. Most AI tools just generate static images (PNGs) that are impossible to tweak for final publication.
The Solution: Paper2Any takes a PDF, text, or sketch as input, understands the research logic, and generates fully editable PPTX (PowerPoint) files and SVGs. We prioritize flexibility and fidelityâ€”allowing you to specify page ranges, switch visual styles, and preserve original assets.
How it works:
1. Multimodal Reading: Extracts text and visual elements from the paper. You can now specify page ranges (e.g., Method section only) to focus the context and reduce token usage.
2. Content Understanding: Identifies core contributions and structural logic.
3. PPT Generation: Instead of generating one flat image, it generates independent elements (blocks, arrows, text) with selectable visual styles and organizes them into a slide layout.

Uses LLMs (Vertex AI, temp=0, strict JSON) to strip political spin.2.  Civic Algorithm: The main feed isnt sorted by an editorial board. Its sorted by user votes (Shadow Parliament). What the community cares about rises to the top.3.  Civic Projects: An incubator for citizen legislation. Users submit drafts (like our Human Preservation Act), which are vetted by AI scoring and displayed with visual parity alongside government bills.Tech Stack:Frontend: Flutter (Web  Mobile Monorepo),Backend: Firebase + Google Cloud Run,AI: Vertex AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash),License: PolyForm Noncommercial â€” source is available for inspection, learning, and non-commercial civic use.

75c6b76e-e673-4b0a-b902-bef95eb4fa18,Show HN: Autofix Bot â€“ Hybrid static analysis and AI code review agent,2025-12-11T21:24:34.000Z,Hacker News,"Hi there, HN! Weâ€™re Jai and Sanket from DeepSource (YC W20), and today weâ€™re launching Autofix Bot, a hybrid static analysis + AI agent purpose-built for in-the-loop use with AI coding agents.AI coding agents have made code generation nearly free, and theyâ€™ve shifted the bottleneck to code review. Static-only analysis with a fixed set of checkers isnâ€™t enough. LLM-only review has several limitations: non-deterministic across runs, low recall on security issues, expensive at scale, and a tendency to get â€˜distractedâ€™.We spent the last 6 years building a deterministic, static-analysis-only code review product. Earlier this year, we started thinking about this problem from the ground up and realized that static analysis solves key blind spots of LLM-only reviews. Over the past six months, we built a new â€˜hybridâ€™ agent loop that uses static analysis and frontier AI agents together to outperform both static-only and LLM-only tools in finding and fixing code quality and security issues. Today, weâ€™re opening it up publicly.Hereâ€™s how the hybrid architecture works:- Static pass: 5,000+ deterministic checkers (code quality, security, performance) establish a high-precision baseline. A sub-agent suppresses context-specific false positives.- AI review: The agent reviews code with static findings as anchors. Has access to AST, data-flow graphs, control-flow, import graphs as tools, not just grep and usual shell commands.- Remediation: Sub-agents generate fixes. Static harness validates all edits before emitting a clean git patch.Static solves key LLM problems: non-determinism across runs, low recall on security issues (LLMs get distracted by style), and cost (static narrowing reduces prompt size and tool calls).On the OpenSSF CVE Benchmark [1] (200+ real JSTS vulnerabilities), we hit 81.2% accuracy and 80.0% F1; vs Cursor Bugbot (74.5% accuracy, 77.42% F1), Claude Code (71.5% accuracy, 62.99% F1), CodeRabbit (59.4% accuracy, 36.19% F1), and Semgrep CE (56.9% accuracy, 38.26% F1). 
On secrets detection, 92.8% F1; vs Gitleaks (75.6%), detect-secrets (64.1%), and TruffleHog (41.2%). We use our open-source classification model for this. [2]Full methodology and how we evaluated each tool: https:autofix.botbenchmarks (https:autofix.botbenchmarks)You can use Autofix Bot interactively on any repository using our TUI, as a plugin in Claude Code, or with our MCP on any compatible AI client (like OpenAI Codex).[3] Weâ€™re specifically building for AI coding agent-first workflows, so you can ask your agent to run Autofix Bot on every checkpoint autonomously.Give us a shot today: https:autofix.bot (https:autofix.bot).

7c9b0dbb-5990-4da8-bdfa-b3cafa6077d8,Ask HN: How are you LLM-coding in an established code base?,2025-12-16T18:54:37.000Z,Hacker News,"Hereâ€™s how weâ€™re working with LLMs at my startup.We have a monorepo with scheduled Python data workflows, two Next.js apps, and a small engineering team. We use GitHub for SCM and CICD, deploy to GCP and Vercel, and lean heavily on automation.Local development:
Every engineer gets Cursor Pro (plus Bugbot), Gemini Pro, OpenAI Pro, and optionally Claude Pro. We donâ€™t really care which model people use. In practice, LLMs are worth about 1.5 excellent juniormid-level engineers per engineer, so paying for multiple models is easily worth it.We rely heavily on pre-commit hooks: ty, ruff, TypeScript checks, tests across all languages, formatting, and other guards. Everything is auto-formatted. LLMs make types and tests much easier to write, though complex typing still needs some hand-holding.GitHub + Copilot workflow:
We pay for GitHub Enterprise primarily because it allows assigning issues to Copilot, which then opens a PR. Our rule is simple: if you open an issue, you assign it to Copilot. Every issue gets a code attempt attached to it.Thereâ€™s no stigma around lots of PRs. We frequently delete ones we donâ€™t use.We use Turborepo for the monorepo and are fully uv on the Python side.All coding practices are encoded in .cursorrules files. For example: â€œIf you are doing database work, only edit Drizzleâ€™s schema.ts and donâ€™t hand-write SQL.â€ Cursor generally respects this, but other tools struggle to consistently read or follow these rules no matter how many agent.md-style files we add.My personal dev loop:
If Iâ€™m on the go and see a bug or have an idea, I open a GitHub issue (via Slack, mobile, or web) and assign it to Copilot. Sometimes the issue is detailed; sometimes a single sentence. Copilot opens a PR, and I review it later.If Iâ€™m at the keyboard, I start in Cursor as an agent in a Git worktree, using whatever the best model is. I iterate until Iâ€™m happy, ask the LLM to write tests, review everything, and push to GitHub. Before a human review, I let Cursor Bugbot, Copilot, and GitHub CodeQL review the code, and ask Copilot to fix anything they flag.Things that are still painful:
To really know if code works, I need to run Temporal, two Next.js apps, several Python workers, and a Node worker. Some of this is Dockerized, some isnâ€™t. Then I need a browser to run manual checks.AFAICT, thereâ€™s no service that lets me: give a prompt, write the code, spin up all this infra, run Playwright, handle database migrations, and let me manually poke at the system. We approximate this with GitHub Actions, but that doesnâ€™t help with manual verification or DB work.Copilot doesnâ€™t let you choose a model when assigning an issue or during code review. The model it uses is generally bad. You can pick a model in Copilot chat, but not in issues, PRs or reviews.Cursor + worktrees + agents suck. Worktrees clone from the source repo including unstaged files, so if you want a clean agent environment, your main repo has to be clean. At times it feels simpler to just clone the repo into a new directory instead of using worktrees.Whatâ€™s working well:
Because we constantly spin up agents, our monorepo setup scripts are well-tested and reliable. They also translate cleanly into CICD.Roughly 25% of â€œopen issue â†’ Copilot PRâ€ results are mergeable as-is. Thatâ€™s not amazing, but better than zero, and it gets to ~50% with a few comments. This would be higher if Copilot followed our setup instructions more reliably or let us use stronger models.Overall, for roughly $1kmonth, weâ€™re getting the equivalent of 1.5 additional juniormid engineers per engineer. Those â€œLLM engineersâ€ always write tests, follow standards, produce good commit messages, and work 247. Thereâ€™s friction in reviewing and context-switching across agents, but itâ€™s manageable.What are you doing for vibe coding in a production system?",2025-12-20 00:53:23.958854+00,AI,neutral,Other

Still, I think many teams are very familiar with the problem of marketing wants to change the landing page again.Ive run into this for years. Campaign pages come in, engineers get pulled in, and tickets stack up. Its usually the same components, just rearranged.A few years ago, at a startup I worked at, we built an internal tool to deal with this. You register your existing React components, they show up as drag-and-drop blocks, and the result is a JSX string. No schema to learn, no changes to your component code.We used it in production, handling real traffic in a messy, legacy-heavy environment. It held up well. Over time, it powered roughly 60% of our traffic. Marketing shipped pages without filing tickets, and product teams ran layout-level AB tests. That experience eventually led me to clean it up and open-source it.Composify sits somewhere between a no-code page builder and a headless CMS. Page builders like Wix or Squarespace offer drag-and-drop, but lock you into their components. There are also solid tools like Builder.io, Puck, and Storyblok, but many require you to adapt your components to their model. Composify is intentionally minimal: it lets you use your actual production components as they are.Its still early. The docs need work, and there are rough edges. But its running in production and has solved a real problem for us. If you already have a component library and want non-devs to compose pages from it, it might be useful.Homepage: https:composify.js.org (https:composify.js.org)Happy to answer questions or hear feedback!",2025-12-20 00:53:23.958854+00,Other,positive,Product Launch

85736448-4921-44b0-a85c-f014b145ab96,Launch HN: InspectMind (YC W24) â€“ AI agent for reviewing construction drawings,2025-12-10T16:05:03.000Z,Hacker News,"Hi HN, were Aakash and Shuangling of InspectMind (https:www.inspectmind.ai (https:www.inspectmind.ai)), an AI â€œplan checkerâ€ that finds issues in construction drawings, details, and specs.Construction drawings quietly go out with lots of errors: dimension conflicts, co-ordination gaps, material mismatches,  missing details and more. These errors turn into delays and hundreds of thousands of dollars of rework during construction. InspectMind reviews the full drawing set of a construction project in minutes. It cross-checks architecture, engineering, and specifications to catch issues that cause rework before building begins.Hereâ€™s a video with some examples: https:www.youtube.comwatch?v=Mvn1FyHRlLQ (https:www.youtube.comwatch?v=Mvn1FyHRlLQ).Before this, I (Aakash) built an engineering firm that worked on ~10,000 buildings across the US. One thing that always frustrated us: a lot of design coordination issues donâ€™t show up until construction starts. By then, the cost of a mistake can be 10â€“100x higher, and everyone is scrambling to fix problems that could have been caught earlier.We tried everything including checklists, overlay reviews, peer checks but scrolling through 500â€“2000 PDF sheets and remembering how every detail connects to every other sheet is a brittle process. City reviewers and GC pre-con teams try to catch issues too, yet they still sneak through.We thought: if models can parse code and generate working software, maybe they can also help reason about the built environment on paper. So we built something we wished we had!You upload drawings and specs (PDFs). The system breaks them into disciplines and detail hierarchies, parses geometry and text, and looks for inconsistencies: - Dimensions that donâ€™t reconcile across sheets; - Clearances blocked by mechanicalarchitectural elements; - Firesafety details missing or mismatched; - Spec requirements that never made it into drawings; - Callouts referencing details that donâ€™t exist.The output is a list of potential issues with sheet refs and locations for a human to review. We donâ€™t expect automation to replace design judgment, just to help ACE professionals not miss the obvious stuff. Current AIs are good at obvious stuff, plus can process data at quantities way beyond what humans can accurately do, so this is a good application for them.Construction drawings arent standardized and every firm names things differently. Earlier â€œautomated checkingâ€ tools relied heavily on manually-written rules per customer, and break when naming conventions change. Instead, weâ€™re using multimodal models for OCR + vector geometry, callout graphs across the entire set, constraint-based spatial checks, and retrieval-augmented code interpretation. No more hard-coded rules!Weâ€™re processing residential, commercial, and industrial projects today. Latency ranges from minutes to a few hours depending on sheet count. Thereâ€™s no onboarding required, simply upload PDFs. There are still lots of edge cases (PDF extraction weirdness, inconsistent layering, industry jargon), so weâ€™re learning a lot from failures, maybe more than successes. But the tech is already delivering results that couldnâ€™t be done with previous tools.Pricing is pay-as-you-go: we give an instant online quote per project after you upload the project drawings. Itâ€™s hard to do regular SaaS pricing since one project may be a home remodel and another may be a highrise. Weâ€™re open to feedback on that too, weâ€™re still figuring it out.If you work with drawings as an architect, engineer, MEP, GC preconstruction, real estate developer, plan reviewer  weâ€™d love a chance to run a sample set and hear what breaks, whatâ€™s useful, and whatâ€™s missing!Weâ€™ll be here all day to go into technical details about geometry parsing, clustering failures, code reasoning attempts or real-world construction stories about how things go wrong.

We wanted to let kids combine the power of their ideas with AI tools but we needed to make sure we did it safely and in the right way.Enter Stickerbox, a voice powered sticker printer. By combining AI image generation with thermal sticker printing, we instantly turn kids wildest ideas into real stickers they can color, stick, and share.What surprised us most is how the â€œAIâ€ disappears behind the magic of the device. The moment that consistently amazes kids is when the printer finishes and they are holding their own idea as a real sticker. A ghost on a skateboard, a dragon doing its taxes, their dog as a superhero, anything they can dream of, they can hold in their hand. Their reactions are what pushed us to keep building, even though hardware can be really hard.Along the way the scope of the project grew more than we expected: navigating supply chains, sourcing safe BPABPS free thermal paper, passing safety testing for a childrenâ€™s product, and designing an interface simple enough that a five year old can walk up and just talk to it. We also spent a lot of time thinking about kidsâ€™ data and privacy so that parents would feel comfortable having this in their home.Stickerbox is our attempt to make modern AI kid-safe, playful, and tangible.

A unified terminal UI for coding agents,2025-12-18T16:49:12.000Z,Hacker News,"Hi HN,Up to the middle of 2025, I was the CEOCTO of a startup called Textualize. Somehow I had managed to land seed funding for my Python libraries for fancy terminal output. We wrapped up after three years because the funding ran dry.I honestly thought I was sick of coding at that point. But it turns out I was sick of the stress and working all hours. A few weeks rest was all I needed.It was about that time that coding agents exploded, and I could no longer ignore them. I wasnt impressed with the UI these tools offered. Having worked in the terminal for a few years, I knew you could get a better user experience. And so this project was born.I had planned to create some kind of layer between the agents SDK and the front-end. Fortunately after I started building this, Zed Industries released Agent Client Protocol (https:agentclientprotocol.com (https:agentclientprotocol.com)). Which was precisely what I needed.Ive just released the code (It was a private repo for a while). Toad (a play on Textual Code) can run a large number of AI agents, which a nicer terminal UI.Think of it as a bring your own agent coding CLI. Use whatever agent you want. Im not trying to sell you tokens.Ask me anything. Ill be hanging around for a while, if this post takes off.",2025-12-20 00:57:07.998843+00,AI,positive,Product Launch

I built Linggen to solve this.My Workflow:
I use the Linggen VS Code extension to init my day. It calls the Linggen MCP to load memory instantly. Linggen indexes all my docs like itâ€™s remembering themâ€”it is awesome. One click loads the full architectural context, removing the cold start problem.The Tech:Local-First: Rust + LanceDB. Code and embeddings stay on your machine. No accounts required.Team Memory: Index knowledge so teammates LLMs get context automatically.Visual Map: See file dependencies and refactor blast radius.MCP-Native: Supports Cursor, Zed, and Claude Desktop.Linggen saves me hours.

I wanted to use open source datasets to track the rapid expansion, especially per-county, as this data can be crucial for deflock movements to petition counties and city governments to ban and remove them.In some counties, the tracking becomes so widespread that most people cant go anywhere without being photographed.

b1a1733c-2f35-4cd7-88d1-b45f77783ebf,Show HN: I built a fast RSS reader in Zig,2025-12-16T19:55:56.000Z,Hacker News,"Well, I certainly tried. I had to, because it has a certain quirk inspired by digital minimalism.The quirk is that it only allows you to fetch new articles once per day (or X days).Why? Let me explain...I want my internet content to be like a boring newspaper. You get it in the morning, and you read the whole thing while sipping your morning coffee, and then youre done! No more new information for today. No pings, no alerts, peace, quiet, zen, etc.But with that, I needed it to be able to fetch all articles from my hundreds of feeds in one sitting. This is where Zig and curl optimisations come in. I tried to do all the tricks in the book. If I missed something, let me know!First off, Im using curl multi for the network layer. The cool thing is it automatically does HTTP2 multiplexing, which means if your feeds are hosted on the same CDN it reuses the same connection. Ive got it configured to handle 50 connections total with up to 6 per host, which seems to be the sweet spot before servers start getting suspicious. Also, conditional GETs. If a feed hasnt changed since last time, the server just says Not Modified and we bail immediately.While curl is downloading feeds, I wouldnt want CPU just being idle so the moment curl finishes downloading a single feed, it fires a callback that immediately throws the XML into a worker thread pool for parsing. The main thread keeps managing all the network stuff while worker threads are chewing through XML in parallel. Zigs memory model is perfect for this. Each feed gets its own ArenaAllocator, which is basically a playground where you can allocate strings during parsing, then when were done, we just nuke the entire arena in one go.For parsing itself, Im using libexpat because it doesnt load the entire XML into memory like a DOM parser would. This matters because some podcast feeds especially are like 10MB+ of XML. So with smart truncation we download the first few X mbs (configurable), scan backwards to find the last complete item tag, cut it there, and parse just that. Keeps memory usage sane even when feed sizes get massive.And for the UI I just pipe everything to the systems less command. You get vim navigation, searching, and paging for free. Plus Im using OSC 8 hyperlinks, so you can actually click links to open them on your browser. Zero TUI framework needed. Ive also included OPML importexport and feed groups as additional features.The result: content from hundreds of RSS feeds retrieved in matter of seconds, and peace of mind for the rest of the day.The code is open source and MIT licensed.

There was a huge mental load before posting something on X or Instagram.Every time I wanted to share something small or unfinished, I opened Twitter and lost 20 minutes to the timeline. Writing a blog post felt too heavy for those smaller, quick thoughts. I just wanted a place to write something down quickly and hit publish.Jottings is that place. It gives you a clean microblog on a domain you own. Posts show up in simple chronological order. No likes. No followers. No feed trying to decide what matters.What Jottings is
- A microblogging platform that builds fully static microblog sites
- A free subdomain (you.jottings.me) or connect your own domain on PRO plans
- Markdown, tags, RSS feed, links with preview, and image uploads
- An optional AI writing helper when you are stuck or lazy to fix grammar
- Optimized for SEO and AI search friendly
- Analytics for your sitesWhat it is not
- Not a social network
- Not an engagement funnel
- Not trying to keep you on the site
- Not a replacement for long-form blogging, though you can use it that wayHow it works
Each Jot publish triggers a static site rebuild. The site is stored in Cloudflare R2 and served directly at the edge. Custom domains go through Cloudflare SSL for SaaS.
I built it to be boring, reliable (barring Cloudflares latest issues), and cheap to run.Pricing
Free tier for a subdomain, text posts, and a lot more.
USD5 per month for custom domains, images, full Markdown, and the writing helper.
I priced it to be an easy yes.Limitations
- No comments (on purpose)
- No native apps yet (iOS is coming)
- The writing helper is helpful but not magic
- I am a solo founder, so features move at human speedI use Jottings regularly to document what I build. It has been the lowest-friction way I have found to publish anything publicly.Demo of Jottings site for product updates: https:jottings.jottings.me (https:jottings.jottings.me)
Demo of my personal Jottings site: https:jottings.vishalvshekkar.com (https:jottings.vishalvshekkar.com) (with custom subdomain)I would love feedback from this community. What would make this better or more useful for you?Check it out here: https:jottings.me (https:jottings.me) (2 min set up)

c0e723d6-a467-4e5b-a803-29f086ee5f4f,Launch HN: BrowserBook (YC F24) â€“ IDE for deterministic browser automation,2025-12-11T15:18:51.000Z,Hacker News,"Hey HN!  Weâ€™re Chris, Jorrie, and Evan of BrowserBook, an IDE for writing and debugging Playwright-based web automations. You can download it as a Mac app here: https:browserbook.com (https:browserbook.com), and thereâ€™s a demo video at https:www.youtube.comwatch?v=ODGJBCNqGUI (https:www.youtube.comwatch?v=ODGJBCNqGUI).Why we built this: When we were going through YC, we were a company that automated back-office healthcare workflows.  Since the interoperability ecosystem in healthcare is so fragmented, we started using browser agents to automate EMRs, practice management software, and payment portals directly through the web. When we did, we ran into a ton of problems:Speed: High latency on LLM calls vs. a scripting approachCost: We burned through tokens with all the context we needed to make the automations reasonably accurateReliability: Even with detailed instructions, context, and tools, agents tended to drift on multi-step tasks in unpredictable waysDebuggability: When drift did occur, we were essentially playing whack-a-mole in our prompt and re-running the whole automation to debug issues (see above: speed and cost issues made this quite painful)More and more we were just giving our agent scripts to execute. Eventually, we came to the conclusion that scripting is a better approach for web automation for these sort of use cases. But scripting was also too painful, so we set out to solve those problems with BrowserBook.Under the hood, it runs a standalone TypeScript REPL wired directly into an inline browser instance, with built-in tooling to make script development quick and easy.  This includes:- A fully interactive browser window directly in the IDE so you can run your code without context switching- A Jupyter-notebook-style environment - the idea here is you can write portions of your automation in individual cells and run them individually (and quickly reset manually in the browser), instead of having to rerun the whole thing every time- An AI coding assistant which uses the DOM context of the current page to write automation logic, which helps avoid digging around for selectors- Helper functions for taking screenshots, data extraction, and managed authentication for auth-required workflows.Once youâ€™ve created your automation, you can run it directly in the application or in our hosted environment via API, so you can use it in external apps or agentic workflows.At its core, BrowserBook is an Electron app, so we can run a Chrome instance directly in the app without the need for cloud-hosted browsers. For API runs, we use hosted browser infra via Kernel (which is a fantastic product, btw), relying on their bot anti-detection capabilities (stealth mode, proxies, etc.).Scripted automation can be unpopular because scripts are inherently brittle; unlike â€œtraditionalâ€ software development, your code is deployed in an environment you donâ€™t control - someone elseâ€™s website. With BrowserBook, weâ€™re trying to â€œembrace the suckâ€, and acknowledge this â€œoffensive programmingâ€ environment.Weâ€™ve designed from the ground up to assume scripts will break, and aim to provide the tools that make building and maintaining them easier. In the future, our plan is to leverage AI where it has shown its strength already - writing code - to minimize downtime and quickly repair broken scripts as the deployed environment changes.Browser agents promised to solve this by handing the reins to an LLM which can handle inconsistency and ambiguity. While we think there are some applications where browser agents can be genuinely helpful, tasks that need to be done reliably and repeatedly are not one of them.Weâ€™d love for you to try it out!  You can download BrowserBook from our website here: https:browserbook.com (https:browserbook.com) (only available for Mac so far, sorry!) And of course, weâ€™d appreciate any feedback and comments you have!",2025-12-16 02:48:44.612975+00,AI,positive,Product Launch

The core of this algorithm relies on modulo-4 arithmetic on the stalks remaining after a random split.To make it physically realistic, I used a Box-Muller transform to simulate the user splitting the stalks with a Gaussian distribution (since humans naturally tend to split near the middle), rather than a uniform random split.I was worried this human bias might skew the modulo probabilities, so I ran a 1-million-run Monte Carlo simulation to verify.The Result: The remainders [0,1,2,3] still emerged with a near-perfect 25% distribution (deviation  0.05%).So, the app simulates the physics of human imperfection while preserving the mathematical perfection of the probability distribution (where Old Yin is 116).Stack: Next.js + Tailwind cssHappy to answer any questions about the math or the hexagrams!",2025-12-16 02:46:24.768005+00,Other,positive,Product Launch

The main work is translating the UI templates into idiomatic SvelteKit while maintaining the original styling. This includes things like using semantic HTML instead of div-spamming, not wrapping divs in divs in divs, and replacing bootstrap with minimal tailwind. It also includes some logic refactors, to maintain the original functionality but rewritten to avoid years of code debt. Things like replacing templates using boolean flags for multiple views with composable Svelte components.Ive had a fairly steady process for doing this: look at each route defined in Django, build out my `+page.server.ts`, and then split each major section of the page into a Svelte component with a matching Storybook story. It takes a lot of time to do this, since I have to ensure Im not just copying the template but rather recreating it in a more idiomatic style.This kind of work seems like a great use case for AI assisted programming, but Ive failed to use it effectively. At most, I can only get Claude Code to recreate some slightly less spaghetti code in Svelte. Simple prompting just isnt able to get AIs code quality within 90% of what Id write by hand. Ideally, AI could get its code to something I could review manually in 15-20 minutes, which would massively speed up the time spent on this project (right now it takes me 1-2 hours to properly translate a route).Do you guys have tips or suggestions on how to improve my efficiency and code quality with AI?",2025-12-16 02:48:44.612975+00,AI,neutral,Other

e8b3841b-89cb-44a1-a63c-819643ce6709,Show HN: Open-source customizable AI voice dictation built on Pipecat,2025-12-14T16:21:35.000Z,Hacker News,"Tambourine is an open source, fully customizable voice dictation system that lets you control STTASR, LLM formatting, and prompts for inserting clean text into any app.I have been building this on the side for a few weeks. What motivated it was wanting a customizable version of Wispr Flow where I could fully control the models, formatting, and behavior of the system, rather than relying on a black box.Tambourine is built directly on top of Pipecat and relies on its modular voice agent framework. The back end is a local Python server that uses Pipecat to stitch together STT and LLM models into a single pipeline. This modularity is what makes it easy to swap providers, experiment with different setups, and maintain fine-grained control over the voice AI.I shared an early version with friends and recently presented it at my local Claude Code meetup. The response was overwhelmingly positive, and I was encouraged to share it more widely.The desktop app is built with Tauri. The front end is written in TypeScript, while the Tauri layer uses Rust to handle low level system integration. This enables the registration of global hotkeys, management of audio devices, and reliable text input at the cursor on both Windows and macOS.At a high level, Tambourine gives you a universal voice interface across your OS. You press a global hotkey, speak, and formatted text is typed directly at your cursor. It works across emails, documents, chat apps, code editors, and terminals.Under the hood, audio is streamed from the TypeScript front end to the Python server via WebRTC. The server runs real-time transcription with a configurable STT provider, then passes the transcript through an LLM that removes filler words, adds punctuation, and applies custom formatting rules and a personal dictionary. STT and LLM providers, as well as prompts, can be switched without restarting the app.The project is still under active development. I am working through edge cases and refining the UX, and there will likely be breaking changes, but most core functionality already works well and has become part of my daily workflow.I would really appreciate feedback, especially from anyone interested in the future of voice as an interface.",2025-12-16 02:47:18.308202+00,AI,positive,Product Launch

eb1912b7-72d0-465e-8c87-b61e29a446c2,Launch HN: Kenobi (YC W22) â€“ Personalize your website for every visitor,2025-12-17T16:44:13.000Z,Hacker News,"Hey HN! Weâ€™re Rory, Chris, and Felix from Kenobi (https:kenobi.ai (https:kenobi.ai)). Kenobi lets you add AI-based content personalization to any website. As a site owner, you install our personalization widget with a script tag, just like you would for e.g. a chatbot integration. As a visitor, you interact with the widget (right now by providing a company name) and Kenobi changes the site content to suit you.Weâ€™ve built a demo that anyone can try here: https:kenobi.aistart (https:kenobi.aistart)We believe that large parts of the web are about to go from being static to dynamic because of how adept LLMs are at transforming rendered HTML. And right now weâ€™re focussing on B2B landing page content (as opposed to application UIs) because there is a lot of commercial opportunity for increasing top-of-funnel inbound conversions.Our journey to Kenobi today is a long and snaking one. You may notice from the post title that we did YCâ€™s Winter 2022 batch (I know that 4 years is practically ancient in YC-dog-years). Kenobi is a hard pivot from our original idea that we got accepted into YC with â€” a company called Verdn which did trackable environmental donations via an API. Since the summer, weâ€™ve been hacking on different ideasâ€¦ We started with personalized UI screenshots for outbound campaigns, but then people told us they wanted transformations to their actual site[0] â€” so we built an agentic workflow to research a visitor-company and â€œpre-renderâ€ changes to a landing site for them. Ultimately, there was too much friction in getting people to incorporate personalized URLs into their cold outbound campaigns[1]. Besides, people kept asking for us to do this for their inbound traffic, and so our current iteration was born.Right now with Kenobi you pick a page that youâ€™d like to make customizable, and choose [text] elements that youâ€™d like to make dynamic. You can define custom prompting instructions for these elements, and when someone visits your page, our agentic workflow researches their company, and presents the updated content as quickly as possible, usually within a few seconds.[2] You also get a ping in Slack every time this happens so you know who is using your site.Weâ€™ve been experimenting with features such as generating custom imagery that actually looks good and native to the page design, and pulling in company data sources so that e.g. the right case study can be presented based on a visitorâ€™s industry and ICP profile. Our most requested feature is deanonymizing traffic so that Kenobiâ€™s personalization can happen automatically as visitors land on your page â€” this is coming very soon, as right now you have to specify where youâ€™re coming from.Itâ€™s surprised us just how much business value weâ€™ve gotten from knowing who (most probably) is on the page and asking for a personalized experience. Weâ€™ve seen response rates 3x of what we would normally from following people up from companies we know visited our site.There are many players in this space already, and everyone seems to have their own angle. We are keen to hear thoughts on what people think the future of the personalized internet looks like!Cheers from London!P.S. - theres also a video that Chris recorded showing the end-to-end Kenobi experience right now https:www.loom.comsharebc0a82a2f2fd40f695315bae80e8f5d8 (https:www.loom.comsharebc0a82a2f2fd40f695315bae80e8f5d8)[0] - Many of them had tried AI â€œmicrositeâ€ generators but found the maintenance of managing a separate website(s) just for closing deals to be burdensome and inefficient.[1] - Despite having a CSV export and Clay integration option for our pre-generated website changes, getting people to weave the URLs into their email sequences (everyone uses different tools) seemed almost insurmountable without building what would ostensibly be our own sequencing software.[2] - We use light foundation models with grounded search for the research step, and translate these into markup changes via another light LLM pass and our own DSL which is optimized for speed.",2025-12-20 00:54:17.04327+00,AI,positive,Product Launch

Same vendors, same categories, same patterns every month. Humans hate this work. Software loves it.With accounting, at least at the small-business level, most of the work feels like:normalize data from banks  cards  invoicesapply deterministic or configurable rulessurface exceptions for human reviewrun consistency checks and reportsThe truly hard parts (tax strategy, edge cases, messy history, talking to authorities) are a smaller fraction of the total hours but require humans.

This reveals the moment a value appears in memory and the user-land function responsible for creating it.Another interesting feature is the Live Object Search: it inspects runtime objects (not just snapshots), supports regex and object similarity, and lets you patch objects directly at runtime.Whitepaper:

And I didnt find Existing SQL TUIs intuitive, having to read documentation to learn keybindings and CLI flags to connect. Given I had recently switched to linux, I found myself using vs codes sql database extension. Something was awfully wrong.I wanted something like lazygit for databases â€“ run it, connect, and query and frankly just make it enjoyable to access data.  Sqlit is a keyboard-driven SQL TUI with:

  - Context-based keybindings (always visible)
  - Neovim-like interface with normal and insert mode for query editing
  - Browse databases, tables, views, stored procedures
  - Adapters for SQL Server, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Turso  more
  - SSH tunneling support
  - Themes (Tokyo Night, Nord, Gruvbox etc.)

  Inspired by lazygit, neovim and lazysql. Built with PythonTextual.

Feedback welcome â€“ especially on which adapters to prioritize next. My vision of sqlit is to make a tool that makes it easy to connect and query data, and to do that, and that thing only, really well.https:github.comMaxteabagsqlit (https:github.comMaxteabagsqlit)",2025-12-20 00:54:37.771289+00,Other,positive,Product Launch

For real-world deployments, we see the DuckDB Data Accelerator often capping out around 1TB, but Spice Cayenne can do Petabyte-scale.You can read about it at https:spice.aiblog (https:spice.aiblog) and in the Spice OSS release notes [4].This is just the first version, and weâ€™d love to get your feedback!GitHub: https:github.comspiceaispiceai (https:github.comspiceaispiceai)[1] https:news.ycombinator.comitem?id=28448887 (https:news.ycombinator.comitem?id=28448887)[2] https:news.ycombinator.comitem?id=39854584 (https:news.ycombinator.comitem?id=39854584)[3] https:github.comvortex-datavortex (https:github.comvortex-datavortex)[4] https:spiceai.orgblogreleasesv1.9.0 (https:spiceai.orgblogreleasesv1.9.0)",2025-12-20 00:55:00.07102+00,AI,positive,Product Launch
